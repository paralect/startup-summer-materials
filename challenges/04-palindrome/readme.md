##Info:

**Palindrome**: a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols or elements, whose meaning may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction

##Task:

1. Implement `isPalindrome` function in the `index.js`.
2. Make sure all test passes.


##Notes:

1. Any working solution will be accepted, but if result function will be less than 80 chars you'll get an **extra 2 points**
2. You can use `npm start` to run app

## Hints
1. To implement a solution in less than 80 chars you gonna need to use [regular expressions](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp)
